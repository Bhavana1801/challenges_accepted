Hi All,

        Suppose you are working for a cricket information website(like espncricinfo or cricbuzz) where you have data of several countries and you need to sort them based on certain criterion. The data is given as a list of rows, where each row has the following format

TeamName #Wins #Losses #Draws

Assuming that each Team name is unique, you have to sort team names
a. First by decreasing number of wins(i.e team with relatively more number of wins should get lesser rank).
b. then by increasing number of losses.
c. then by decreasing number of draws.
You could also assume that no two teams have same values for all Wins, Losses and Draws.

For example on the following data
England 	4 2 3
India 		5 2 4
Australia 	6 2 3
SouthAfrica 5 3 4
Bangladesh 	3 4 2
Zimbabwe 	3 4 6
Ireland 	3 4 1
the sorted order is
Australia India SouthAfrica England Zimbabwe Bangladesh Ireland
