I should like to enjoy a healthier lifestyle although 
there are many factors that make this difficult. 
Like many people my working life involves 
many hours sitting down at a computer screen. 
This leads to a lack of exercise and is bad for eyes and body posture. Travelling to work by car does not help either. Outside work there is not always time to take exercise or to prepare healthy meals. I know this kind of lifestyle affects my health and fitness and makes me more prone to suffer from illness. It also makes me put on weight. To have a healthier lifestyle I need to change the routine of my daily life, for example by cycling or walking to work instead of driving. I need to ensure more regular exercise even if this is only 10 minutes yoga in the morning. I also need to eat more carefully, especially fruit and vegetables, and not eat so much convenience food or red meat. At work I should take regular breaks away from the computer to relax my eyes and stretch my body. I plan to slow down and take time to enjoy simple pleasures like a well-cooked healthy meal or some sport in the sunshine.
